# Project Task List

[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-badge-url]

Something for me to use to store task list information. This is also being used as an experiment with Firebase hosting, the Firestore database, and PWA development using Angular and Ionic.

## Developing

* `npm i`
* `npm test`
* `npm start`

## Deploying

* make sure everything is committed and that the local `master` is in sync with the origin `master`
* `npm run release`
