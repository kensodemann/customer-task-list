# Customer Task List

Something for me (or other people who find it, if any) to use to store task list information.

## Developing

* `npm i`
* `npm test`
* `npm start`

## Deploying

This will probably be replaced with a full release process at some point, but it is a little early for that right now.

* `npm run build`
* `firestore deploy`
